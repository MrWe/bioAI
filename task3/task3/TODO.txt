1. Import jobs DONE
2. Create jobs object DONE
    - Contains array of sub-jobs -> job number, machine number and duration DONE

3. Create machine object DONE
    - Init with empty sub-job array. DONE
    - Populate with VALID sub-jobs DONE
    - Valid function: DONE
        -  sub-job 2 of job 1 cannot be before sub-job 1 of job 1. DONE
        - Sub-jobs cannot overlap DONE
        - Sub-jobs must start after sum of all previous durations of the same job. DONE

4. Create gene DONE
   - Sorted order of sub-jobs which provide a valid solution DONE
        - F.eks. Entire job 1, entire job 2 ... DONE
   - Fitness function
        - Closeness to optimal value
        - Mutate based on length from optimal value -> more when far away, less when close

5. Fill machine objects from gene DONE
6. Plot Gantt-diagram of machines DONE

7. Create populations of individuals(genes) DONE

8. Implement ACO
9. Implement Bees DONE
